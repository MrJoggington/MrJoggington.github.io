                My name is Ghett Lee, and I am an anthropology student of three years. I plan to finish
                my B.A. by 2020, and do amazing things with the power of qualtitative research. There is no
                shortage of questions to why I chose this path, but there is no shortage of answers as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                The profession itself may be found lacking in careers that reach economic solitude, but what
                it lacks, it makes up for with its broad analytical values; it's multiple angles and open minds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anthropology has stood the test of time, and has constantly evolved as humans have for thousands
                years, the future is merely a mystery, where to others it is a means of an end. I am proud of my
                domain, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
